\section{Background and Motivation}
\vspace{-3mm}
This first paragraph extensively reviews the existing literature, examines the selected research problem, establishes its theoretical foundations, and highlights its relevance across various contexts. Prior studies have contributed valuable insights through diverse approaches and methodologies, thereby advancing understanding within the field. However, a critical review of this literature reveals several limitations, including fragmented findings, methodological inconsistencies, limited contextual focus, and insufficient empirical validation. These gaps indicate the need for further systematic investigation to integrate existing knowledge, address unresolved issues, and provide a more comprehensive and context-specific understanding of the problem.
